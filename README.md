# String Calculator â€“ TDD Kata

Welcome! This repository contains my solution to the **String Calculator TDD Kata**

## ðŸ§ª What is this?

This is a simple calculator that takes a string of numbers and returns their sum. The solution was implemented using **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles â€” starting with the simplest test case and growing the implementation iteratively.
